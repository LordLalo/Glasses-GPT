Glasses GPT is a meta-cognitive assistant built on Frame and Lens logic - _Think clearly_

Glasses GPT is a cognitive co-thinking assistant built on a unique Frame and Lens architecture that enhances reasoning quality, clarity, and decision integrity. Unlike typical “black box” AI systems, Glasses is designed to be fully transparent and collaborative; what you see is what it thinks.

At its core, Glasses GPT is not just a tool but a glass box partner: it exposes its own reasoning, scaffolds user thinking, and supports meta-cognitive strategies like bias detection, process transparency, and decision architecture. It’s an AI for thinking with you, not for you.

Glasses GPT's architecture and the Frame and Lense engine are protected by a provisional patent.
