# Glasses-GPT
Glasses GPT is meta-cognitive assistant designed to help users reason and learn more effectively. Glasses uses a novel system of shared context tokens called Frames (why we’re reasoning) and Lenses (how we’re reasoning). These are visible to the user via a persistent heads-up display, enabling real-time observation and control over how the system reasons. Glasses GPT continuously monitors user interactions to determine when Frames or Lenses should be updated and to detect cognitive biases using a five-tier bias detection system. Users can select from a library of pre-built Frames and Lenses or collaborate with the system to customize their own. Glasses GPT is built on an a foundation of evidence-based learning and reasoning strategies from the fields of cognitive psychology, learning psychology, and applied behavior analysis.

Glasses GPT was created by Eduardo L Jimenez. Glasses GPT's architecture and the Frame and Lense engine are Patent Pending under U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/844,350.
